## Overview
This week was dedicated to learning about Java's built-in data structures and classic algorithms. We explored how to use and implement linked lists, stacks, queues, hash maps, sorting and searching algorithms, and how to analyze their performance using Big-O notation. We also learned about efficient string handling and file input/output.

- HashMap and hashing functions
- Applications and use-cases

### Day 3: Sorting Algorithms
- Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort, Quick Sort
- Comparing sorting algorithms

### Day 4: Linear and Binary Search, StringBuilder, StringBuffer, BufferedReader, FileReader, InputStreamReader
- Linear search and binary search techniques
- StringBuilder and StringBuffer for efficient string manipulation
- BufferedReader, FileReader, InputStreamReader for file and console I/O

### Day 5: Algorithm's Runtime Analysis & Big-O Notation
- Understanding time and space complexity
- Analyzing the efficiency of algorithms
- Big-O, Big-Theta, and Big-Omega notation
